S&P500 Daily Stock Returns Analysis

Each data file must have a matrix called ProjectData. This matrix has as many rows as days and as many columns as stocks. Every element (i,j) of this matrix is the return (percent) of stock j at day i. 

For example, the default file used e.g. by RunStudy.R (file ProjectData) has 2586 days and 423 stocks. 

The TechData file has only 35 tech stocks (the following stocks:
